# Cobolt IDE — Changelog

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.22.0] — 2026-06-14

Branding, About box, and generated-code lifecycle.

### New

- **Application icon.** The IDE ships with the PowerRustCOBOL samurai icon
  (`assets/images/powerrustcobol-icon.png`), used as the window/taskbar icon and
  overridable via an `app-icon.png` in the config directory.
- **Help → About.** A new About window shows the mascot, version, copyright and
  the Apache-2.0 license.
- **"Powered by PowerRustCOBOL" badge.** A badge (`made-with-powerrustcobol.png`,
  plus a high-resolution `.webp` master) with README + Developer's Guide
  instructions for developers to add it to their own apps' About box.
- **Developer banner in generated COBOL.** Every RAD-generated `.cbl` now opens
  with a `*>` comment block telling the developer it is generated, must not be
  edited directly, and may change structure between versions.
- **Automatic regeneration.** Form COBOL is regenerated from the current forms
  on every **Build / Run / Debug / Check**, so what compiles and runs always
  matches the forms.
- The mascot now appears in the README and the Developer's Guide cover.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.21.0] — 2026-06-14

French interface language.

### New

- **French (Français) UI language.** A sixth interface language joins
  EN/ES/PT/JA/ZH; pick 🇫🇷 Français from the language selector. The full IDE UI
  is translated (menus, toolbar, settings, the form designer and property
  inspector, the debugger, the AI assistant, and the documentation viewer).
  - The Documentation viewer shows the English Developer's Guide for French
    until a French translation of the guide is provided.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.20.0] — 2026-06-14

Documentation viewer with Markdown + Mermaid rendering.

### New

- **Help → Documentation.** A new window renders the embedded PowerRustCOBOL
  documentation (Markdown) with its **Mermaid** diagrams drawn inline — rendered
  in pure Rust (`mermaid-rs-renderer` → SVG → `resvg`), no Node/Chromium.
  - Two-pane layout: a searchable document list and a rendered viewer; the docs
    are embedded at build time (offline), and `Cmd+O` opens any local `.md`.
  - **File** (Print → PDF, Close), **View** (Zoom In/Out, Full Screen, Outline)
    and **Help** (Shortcuts) menus.
  - In-document **search** with **blue-on-yellow** match highlighting, a `Go`
    button and `Enter` to jump to the first match, `◀ / ▶` (and `,` / `.`) to
    step between matches with a live `n/total` counter; the focused match shows
    in orange and is scrolled into view.
  - A clickable **outline** (table of contents) **and** clickable in-document
    `[…](#…)` links that jump to their section.
  - An **icon toolbar** (vector icons) mirroring the shortcuts: open a file
    (Cmd+O), view source (Opt+Cmd+U), keep on top (Cmd+T), print (Cmd+P), close
    (Cmd+W).
  - Adjustable **font size** (`A+ / A−`, Cmd+`+` / Cmd+`-`) that is **remembered
    across sessions**; plus zoom, full-screen, and a view-source modal.
  - A translucent **frosted-glass** window (uneven procedural fog).
  - **Print** renders the document to a PDF (with the diagrams embedded) and
    opens it in the OS viewer. The PDF font is a system sans-serif extracted at
    runtime — nothing is bundled.
  - Theme-aware (adopts the IDE style) and I18N-aware (EN/ES/PT/JA/ZH).

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.19.0] — 2026-06-14

Optional persistence for in-memory indexed files (`STORAGE IS MEMORY`).

### New

- **`STORAGE IS MEMORY WITH PERSISTENCE`** (SELECT-clause extension). An in-RAM
  indexed file can now opt into being written to its disk container **on `CLOSE`
  only** — never on `COMMIT`, so the in-memory performance profile is preserved.
  The phrase combines with compression (`STORAGE IS MEMORY WITH COMPRESSION WITH
  PERSISTENCE`).

### Changed

- **`STORAGE IS MEMORY` is now ephemeral by default.** Without `WITH
  PERSISTENCE`, a MEMORY file's contents are discarded at `CLOSE` (an existing
  disk file is still *loaded* on `OPEN`). `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` on a MEMORY file
  are pure in-RAM transaction boundaries and never touch disk.
- **`OPEN OUTPUT` always (re)creates the on-disk container** for a MEMORY file,
  regardless of the persistence setting, so the file exists on disk.
- The two published `STORAGE IS MEMORY` file-I/O tests were updated to declare
  `WITH PERSISTENCE` (they verify cross-`CLOSE` persistence). New self-checking
  test `tests/cobol/fileio/idx_mem_persist.cbl` covers both modes.

### Docs

- Developer's Guide §14: "Two storage modes" and "When data reaches disk"
  updated for the ephemeral default and `WITH PERSISTENCE`.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.18.0] — 2026-06-13

COBOL-85 language features: binary table search and file-error declaratives.

### New

- **`SEARCH ALL` (binary search).** `SEARCH ALL` now parses and executes as a
  true binary search over an `OCCURS` table declared with an
  `ASCENDING`/`DESCENDING KEY`. The `OCCURS … KEY IS …` phrase is captured
  (previously skipped) and drives the bisection; the `ALL` keyword is recognised
  after `SEARCH` regardless of token form. Serial `SEARCH` is unchanged.
- **`DECLARATIVES` / `USE AFTER STANDARD ERROR PROCEDURE`.** A
  `DECLARATIVES … END DECLARATIVES` block at the head of the `PROCEDURE DIVISION`
  registers file-error handlers. When a file verb (`OPEN`/`READ`/`WRITE`/
  `REWRITE`/`DELETE`/`START`/`CLOSE`) ends with an error `FILE STATUS` that the
  statement did not handle with its own `AT END` / `INVALID KEY` phrase, the
  matching `USE` procedure runs. Targets may be file names, an open mode
  (`INPUT`/`OUTPUT`/`I-O`/`EXTEND`), or a catch-all. New lexer tokens
  (`DECLARATIVES`, `USE`), AST (`ProcedureDivision.declaratives`,
  `UseProcedure`), parser, and runtime dispatch with a re-entrancy guard.

### Fixed

- **`NOT =` (and other negated relations) after `AND`/`OR`.** A negated relational
  condition on the right of a combined condition — e.g. `IF A NOT = X AND B NOT =
  Y` — now parses; previously the bare identifier before `NOT` was mis-read as an
  88-level condition-name, orphaning the `NOT`.
- **Arithmetic statement before a `NOT …` phrase.** An `ADD`/`SUBTRACT`/
  `MULTIPLY`/`DIVIDE`/`COMPUTE` used as the imperative of an `INVALID KEY` /
  `AT END` / `ON EXCEPTION` / `ON OVERFLOW` branch no longer swallows the
  following `NOT` (it previously mis-read `NOT INVALID KEY` etc. as the start of
  `NOT ON SIZE ERROR`). The `NOT` is now consumed only when it actually
  introduces `NOT [ON] SIZE ERROR`.
- **`CALL … USING` parameter passing (nested programs).** Arguments are now bound
  to the called program's `PROCEDURE DIVISION USING` LINKAGE items: values are
  copied in before the call and `BY REFERENCE` arguments receive the updated
  values on return (`BY CONTENT` / `BY VALUE` are not written back). Previously
  the arguments were ignored, so LINKAGE items stayed at their defaults.
- **`STRING … WITH POINTER`.** The pointer is now honoured: text is placed
  starting at the 1-based pointer position (preserving earlier bytes) and the
  pointer is advanced past the last byte moved, with overflow detected from that
  position. Previously the pointer was ignored.
- **Inline `PERFORM WITH TEST BEFORE/AFTER UNTIL`.** The inline (no-paragraph)
  form now accepts the optional `WITH` before `TEST` — e.g.
  `PERFORM WITH TEST AFTER UNTIL … END-PERFORM` — matching the out-of-line form.
  `TEST AFTER` runs the body once before evaluating the condition.
- **`EVALUATE` stacked `WHEN`.** Several consecutive `WHEN` phrases that share a
  single following imperative (e.g. `WHEN 1 WHEN 3 WHEN 5 MOVE …`) now all select
  that imperative, as COBOL-85 requires (previously the value-only `WHEN`s ran an
  empty branch).

### Docs

- Developer's Guide §13: new "Searching tables" and "Centralised file-error
  handling" subsections.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.17.0] — 2026-06-10

IDE visual redesign — "dark glass" look.

### Changed / New

- **Glass card panels.** The project tree, output, main pane and property
  inspector now sit on rounded, subtly-bordered glass cards with soft shadows
  (`theme::glass_panel_frame`).
- **Opaque, pane-matched background.** The whole window is painted with an opaque
  floor + the optional background image + the same pane fill, so the area around
  the panes matches the panes (no desktop bleed / no bright wallpaper in the
  gaps). The "Transparent background" option was **removed**.
- **Collapsible property section cards** in the form inspector (Form Properties /
  Target Device / Appearance / Background Image / Size / Events) with blue ▸/▾
  headers (`section_card`); the widget inspector shares the same blue card-style
  section headers for consistency.
- **New "Deep Blue" theme** (17 total) — near-black glass panes with blue accents.
- **Full-width selection pill** + hover highlight in the tree; **left-aligned**,
  snug rows (fixes centred/jittery labels); grey indent/divider lines removed.
- **Solid semaphore knobs** — the green/yellow/red item-status dots are now crisp
  filled circles.
- **Standardised non-visual widget icons** — Timer/AI-Agent/REST/SQL share one
  glass card and consistent stroke-drawn icons (no more mismatched colours, emoji
  tofu boxes or the one-off orange SQL cylinder).
- **Toolbar** reordered to **Open · Save · Check · Build · Run · Debug · Stop · ⚙**;
  the separate Debug row now only appears during an active debug session.
- **RAD properties panel** resizes up to half the window width (was capped at
  320px, clipping long values); **project tree** defaults to 410px wide.
- Roomier spacing, 8px widget corners, larger fonts retained.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.16.0] — 2026-06-10

IDE: transparent-background option, calmer background, roomier UI.

### New features

- **Transparent background option** (Appearance dialog). When enabled, the IDE
  background colour is fully transparent — the desktop shows through the glass
  panels — and a background image, if set, **keeps its own transparency** (its
  alpha is preserved, scaled only by the opacity slider). Per project
  (`[ide] transparent_background`). In this mode the panels become more
  translucent so the desktop/image reads through.

### Changed

- **Calmer background, more readable panels.** With an opaque background the
  image is now drawn over the themed base and a **low-noise dark overlay** so it
  reads as a subtle backdrop instead of competing with the editor; panels stay
  at full readable opacity (they are no longer force-thinned just because an
  image is set).
- **Roomier, softer UI.** More spacing between rows and around sections (larger
  item spacing, button padding, row height, window/menu margins) and softer
  widget corners (8 px radius) for a less cramped, more polished feel.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.15.2] — 2026-06-10

IDE: assets can be added and ship with the build.

### Fixed

- **The Assets category now accepts any file** (images, audio, video, fonts,
  data, …). The "Add" picker passed a `"*"` filter to the native dialog, which
  greyed out every file on macOS/GTK; assets now open with **no extension
  filter** so anything is selectable.
- **Adding a file from outside the project now imports it.** Previously a file
  outside the project directory was rejected ("must be inside the project
  directory"). The chosen file is now **copied into a category subfolder**
  (`src/`, `forms/`, `assets/`, `docs/`) and tracked, so it becomes part of the
  project. The add is also routed to the category you clicked (not guessed from
  the extension).

### Changed

- **Bundled assets ship with the native build.** `cobolt build` now copies every
  tracked Assets/Documentation file next to the produced binary (under `bin/`,
  preserving the project-relative layout), so images/audio/fonts are available
  to the program at runtime. (The `.zip` package already included them.)

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.15.1] — 2026-06-10

IDE: background image now actually shows, lighter divider lines on dark themes,
and 10 more colour themes.

### Fixed

- **The IDE background image now appears.** It was painted on the background
  layer but the panels tiled the whole window at ~80–95 % opacity, hiding it.
  Now, when a background image is set, the panels become noticeably more
  translucent (frosted glass), the image is drawn over an **opaque themed base**
  (replacing the desktop bleed-through) so it reads as a real wallpaper, and the
  opacity slider dims it via a scrim. Default opacity raised to **70 %**.
- **Divider/border lines are light-grey on dark themes** (and a mid-grey on
  light themes) so separators are clearly visible against the dark chrome.

### New features

- **10 more colour themes** (16 total): Dracula, Nord, One Dark, Gruvbox Dark,
  Tokyo Night, Night Owl, Cobalt2, Solarized Light, GitHub Dark, and Material
  Palenight — alongside the existing Dark Glass (default), Dark+, Light+,
  Monokai, Solarized Dark and High Contrast.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.15.0] — 2026-06-10

IDE: selectable colour themes + per-project background image, and a real fix for
form edits not reflecting in the Main Pane.

### New features

- **IDE colour themes (VSCode-inspired).** A new **Appearance** dialog (the ⚙
  button on the toolbar) lets you pick a colour theme. Six themes ship:
  **Dark Glass** (the default — identical to the previous look), **Dark+**,
  **Light+**, **Monokai**, **Solarized Dark**, and **High Contrast**. The theme
  drives the whole IDE chrome *and* the COBOL editor's syntax colours. The choice
  is saved **per project** (`cobolt.toml` → `[ide] theme`). New `theme` module
  (`crate::theme`): a flat `Theme` palette + registry; `apply_glass_visuals` and
  the editor's syntax layouter both read it.
- **Per-project background image with opacity (transparency) control** — just like
  the RAD form designer. In the same Appearance dialog you can browse for an image
  and set its opacity (0–100 %); it is painted behind the translucent glass panels
  of the main IDE window, scaled to cover. Stored per project
  (`[ide] background_image` + `background_opacity`). `IdeSettings` added to the
  project model with serde defaults so existing projects upgrade transparently.

### Fixed

- **Form property changes now reflect in the Main Pane.** The inline
  form/control inspector loaded the form once and never refreshed, so edits made
  (and saved) in the Designer window — or any external write of the `.cfrm` —
  were not shown when you returned to the Main Pane. The inspector now
  **live-reloads from disk on modification-time change** (preserving the selected
  control), so saving a form anywhere is reflected immediately. (Regression test:
  `inspect_refresh_tests`.)

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.14.0] — 2026-06-10

IDE: controlled project tree, read-only generated code, richer toolbar.

### New features

- **Controlled project treeview** with five fixed, IDE-owned top categories —
  **Forms · Common Code · Generated Code · Assets · Documentation** — each with a
  professional icon. The four developer categories have a `[+]` to add
  sub-entries; developers can only add files *within* a category, never create
  top nodes. (`Documentation` is a new category; `cobolt.toml` gains
  `documentation` + `generated` lists, loaded with serde defaults so existing
  projects upgrade transparently.)
- **The project itself is the tree root** (project name + version); the five
  categories nest under it. Category and file **icons are 80 % larger**, and
  everything **below level 3 is collapsed by default** (Project · Category · Item
  stay open).
- **Forms expand to their controls**, grouped by RAD toolbox category with
  **Non-Visual first** (then Common, Container, Data, Graphics, Menus, Charts,
  Dialogs). **Single-click a file** opens it in the **Main Pane** (formerly the
  editor area); **single-click a form** shows its properties inline, **double-click**
  opens the RAD designer.
- **Widget events in the tree.** A control with event handlers expands to an
  **Events** group; clicking an event opens the form's generated COBOL at that
  event's paragraph (read-only).
- **Selection highlight** — the clicked tree element is highlighted as selected.
- **Debug is gated on a Generated Code selection** — the Debug button is enabled
  only when a generated-code item is selected in the tree (debugging targets the
  RAD-generated backend), with an explanatory tooltip otherwise.
- **Inline property inspector in the Main Pane.** Clicking a form or one of its
  controls in the tree shows the **same properties pane as the RAD** in the Main
  Pane — edit parameters and they're saved back to the `.cfrm` without opening
  the designer (an "Open in Designer" button is offered for deeper edits). It
  **reuses the designer's `PropertiesPanel`** (and its `set_property`/
  `set_form_prop` logic) via a transient panel — no duplicated property code, no
  designer window.
- **Semaphore status dot** to the left of every tree element: **green** = tested/
  checked OK and unchanged, **yellow** = changed since the last check (or never
  tested), **red** = check found an error / failed. `do_check` sets green/red;
  editing a file (since its last check) flips it back to yellow; controls inherit
  their form's status.
- **Generated Code is its own read-only category.** Each form's RAD-generated
  COBOL (output of the form designer, one entry per form, named after it) lives
  under the **Generated Code** node — IDE-owned (no `[+]`), shown in blue with a
  🔒 badge, and opened **non-editable** in the editor (a flat-blue layout, never
  saved over) for review/debug only. Hand-written **Common Code** — the pure
  COBOL-85 modules `CALL`ed by forms — stays fully editable and contains no
  generated files.
- **Toolbar gains Build (binary), Run (interpreted) and Debug**, alongside Stop /
  Check / Open / Save.
- **Compile-gating**: Run / Debug / Build are enabled only when the project has
  at least one COBOL program (hand-written or generated) **or** at least one
  form; otherwise they're disabled with an explanatory tooltip.
- i18n: new keys for all five languages (categories, tree affordances, toolbar
  Build/Debug, the compile-gating tooltip).

### Design (not yet implemented)

- `docs/ide-collaboration-design.md` — the multi-developer collaboration design
  (Phase B): a **pluggable `SyncBackend`** (local-only · local git · GitHub ·
  Google Drive), pessimistic file-level locking (warn-once, read-only for the
  second developer, re-offer on release), change propagation, and a phased
  rollout starting from a trivial local backend. Design only — no code.

### Theme

- **Fonts are 50 % larger** (UI text styles and the code editor). The colour
  palette is unchanged (the dark glass theme is kept).

### Fixed

- **Form property changes now reflect in the IDE on save.** Saving a form (from
  the RAD designer or the inline Main-Pane inspector) refreshes the tree's cached
  form, **regenerates the backend COBOL** (so Generated Code reflects the change),
  keeps it tracked, and reloads any open generated editor tab.

### Tests

- `project_model` unit tests (category routing, generated detection incl. legacy
  stem-match, compile-gating). Full suite 414 passing.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.13.1] — 2026-06-10

Bug fix: `IF … ELSE …` sentence scoping (and `NEXT SENTENCE` with it).

### Fixed

- **A period-terminated `IF … ELSE …` (no `END-IF`) no longer absorbs the
  following sentences into the `ELSE` branch.** The parser now treats a period
  as a terminator of an `IF` branch, so subsequent sentences are siblings of the
  `IF`. This also fixes **`NEXT SENTENCE` inside an `IF … ELSE …`**, which had
  jumped one sentence too far (the statement after the IF was skipped). `NEXT
  SENTENCE` now lands correctly for both the period- and `END-IF`-terminated
  forms. (`crates/cobolt-parser/src/stmt.rs`: `parse_if`/`parse_stmts`.)

### Cleanup

- Removed dead `parse_recognized_noop` (its "UNLOCK/ALTER/RELEASE/RETURN no-op"
  comment was stale — all four are implemented). Renamed
  `parse_initialize_as_move` → `parse_initialize` and corrected its comment
  (INITIALIZE is fully implemented, not a MOVE-SPACES shortcut).

### Tests

- `test_control_flow`: NEXT SENTENCE in `IF … ELSE` (period and `END-IF`) and a
  plain `IF/ELSE` sentence-scoping regression. Full suite 410 passing.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.13.0] — 2026-06-10

INDEXED log rotation — keep each log file under 100 KiB.

### New feature

- **The INDEXED observability log now rotates** (logrotate/Grafana style). When
  the active `<assign-path>.log` approaches **100 KiB** it is renamed to
  **`<user|no-user>.<datafile>.log.<timestamp>`** and a fresh active log is
  started, so no single file grows without bound.
  - `<user>` is the `OPEN … WITH REGISTERED USER` value (sanitized for the
    filesystem); when the OPEN supplies no user, **`no-user`** is used in the
    rotated file name.
  - `<timestamp>` is a compact UTC stamp, e.g. `20260610T120230461Z`.
  - Rotated archives are complete, parseable logs; the runtime never deletes
    them (prune/ship them with your log pipeline).

### Tests & docs

- `indexed_log` unit tests for rotation (active stays under the cap; rotated file
  named with the user, and `no-user` when absent). Verified end-to-end via
  `rcrun` (a 700-commit run rotates at 512 lines, active stays ~38 KiB). Full
  suite 407 passing.
- `docs/observability.md` §1.2 documents rotation.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.12.0] — 2026-06-10

`OPEN … WITH REGISTERED USER` — record the operator in the INDEXED log.

### New language feature

- **`OPEN {INPUT|OUTPUT|I-O|EXTEND} file … WITH REGISTERED [USER] {literal |
  data-item}`** (PowerRustCOBOL extension). Since COBOL programs rarely sit
  behind an authentication engine, the operator/user is supplied explicitly on
  `OPEN`; it is recorded as a `user=` field on **every** event line of that
  file's session in the INDEXED observability log (`OPEN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`/
  `CLOSE`). `USER` is optional; the value may be a string literal or a data item.
  Purely observational — no authentication/authorization, and no effect when the
  log is off.

### Docs & tests

- `docs/observability.md` §1.3.1 (the new clause + examples); the `user` field
  added to the field table. `docs/cobol85-supported-syntax.md` updated.
- Tests: parser (`open_with_registered_user_literal_and_data_item`) and an
  end-to-end interpreter+log assertion (`open_with_registered_user_appears_in_log`).
  Full suite 405 passing.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.11.0] — 2026-06-10

redb engine: read/write optimizations + an optional per-file transaction log.

### New features

- **Per-file INDEXED observability log** (redb engine). Enable with
  `rcrun --indexed-log <basic|full>` (`--indexed-log true` = `basic`) or
  `COBOL_INDEXED_LOG`. Each file gets a sidecar log at `<assign-path>.log`
  (e.g. `customers.idx` → `customers.idx.log`). One `key=value` line per
  transaction event (`OPEN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`/`CLOSE`) records: ISO-8601 UTC
  timestamp, tx id, kind, write/rewrite/delete counts, records, bytes, duration,
  rec/s + bytes/s, and the **ordering quality** of the written keys
  (`order=ordered|unordered`, `in_order`/`out_of_order`). The `full` level also
  appends redb **index statistics** on `CLOSE` (tree height, leaf/branch/
  allocated pages, stored/fragmented bytes) — this walks the index, so it is
  opt-in. Logging is off by default and never affects program behavior.
- **Grafana/Loki-ready log formats.** `--indexed-log-format <text|json>`
  (`COBOL_INDEXED_LOG_FORMAT`) selects the line format. `text` is logfmt
  (Loki `| logfmt`); `json` emits **NDJSON** (Loki `| json`) with numeric metrics
  as bare JSON numbers so Grafana can graph them directly. Default `text`.

### Performance

- **READ NEXT** by the primary key of reference now returns the record straight
  from the range cursor (one B+tree descent per record instead of two) —
  ~17 µs/record sequential scan at 200 k.
- **WRITE** opens the `primary`/`alt` tables once per operation (was twice for
  the duplicate-check + insert). A micro-benchmark showed that caching the table
  handle *across* calls adds only ~8% over once-per-operation, so the simpler,
  `unsafe`-free single-open path was chosen; write cost is dominated by redb's
  ACID insert (~44 µs/record). Durability/crash-safety is unchanged.

### Docs & tests

- New `docs/observability.md` — the observability reference (starts with the
  INDEXED transaction log: flags, field table, formats, Grafana/Loki pipeline,
  cost/safety; plus `COBOLT_LOG` tracing and a roadmap).
- `docs/indexed-redb-engine.md` updated (optimizations; observability log now
  summarized with a pointer to `observability.md`).
- Tests: `indexed_log` unit tests (ISO timestamp, level parsing) and an
  end-to-end log assertion + sequential-scan timing in `test_indexed_redb.rs`.
  Full suite 400 passing.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.10.0] — 2026-06-05

Crash-safe INDEXED engine on a redb substrate (opt-in).

### New features

- **New `STORAGE IS DISK` engine for `ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED`**, built on
  **redb** (pure-Rust embedded ACID key-value store; copy-on-write B+tree, dual
  meta pages, per-page checksums). Opt-in via `--indexed-engine redb` or
  `COBOL_INDEXED_ENGINE=redb`; the default disk engine stays `PRCIDXD1`. It meets
  four operational goals the bespoke engine could not at scale:
  - **OPEN is O(1)** — only the meta page is read; no in-RAM record directory and
    no recovery scan, even after a crash (~5 ms to OPEN a 200 000-record file).
  - **RANDOM/NEXT reads** are B+tree / range operations over redb's page cache
    (~21 µs per random read at 200 000 records).
  - **Resident RAM = working set**, not record count (≥250 M records).
  - **Crash safety** — `COMMIT` is a durable redb transaction commit, `ROLLBACK`
    is an abort; a power loss can never leave a torn index.
- Behavioral parity with the default engine: the same versioned fixtures
  (`idx_crud` / `idx_persist` / `idx_tx`) run identically under redb (CRUD,
  primary + alternate `WITH DUPLICATES` in creation order, persistence,
  `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`), with matching file-status codes.
- Pure-Rust dependency (`redb`), no system library — consistent with the bundled
  SQLite / rustls philosophy.

### Docs & tests

- New guide: `docs/indexed-redb-engine.md` (goals, table layout, transaction
  model, parity, limits). Cross-referenced from `docs/indexed-file-internals.md`.
- Tests: `test_indexed_redb.rs` — the three fixtures under redb + direct
  `IndexedStore` checks + an `#[ignore]`d scale smoke test. Full suite 397 passing.

### Notes

- Bulk `WRITE` throughput (~20 k rec/s in one transaction) is a one-time load
  cost; OPEN, reads, and crash-safety are unaffected. Faster bulk loading is a
  tracked future optimization. Promoting redb to the disk default is deferred
  until it has more mileage.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.9.0] — 2026-06-05

PostgreSQL and MySQL support for the database runtime.

### New features

- **The SQL database runtime now speaks three backends** — SQLite,
  **PostgreSQL**, and **MySQL** — behind one unchanged CALL surface
  (`COBOL-OPEN-DB` / `COBOL-EXEC-SQL` / `COBOL-FETCH-ROW` / `COBOL-NEXT-ROW` /
  `COBOL-ROW-COUNT` / `COBOL-CLOSE-DB`). The engine is selected from the
  connection string's scheme:
  - `:memory:` / `sqlite:<path>` / bare path → **SQLite** (bundled)
  - `postgres://…` / `postgresql://…` → **PostgreSQL** (`postgres`, sync)
  - `mysql://…` → **MySQL** (`mysql`, rustls)
  - A COBOL program is portable across all three — only the connection string
    literal changes.
- All values are normalised to text uniformly across backends (NULL → spaces,
  integers/reals as digits, dates as `YYYY-MM-DD[ HH:MM:SS]`), so existing
  `COBOL-FETCH-ROW` code is unaffected.
- **Pure-Rust drivers** — both new backends build with no system library
  (`libpq`/`libmysqlclient`) and no OpenSSL; MySQL uses rustls.
- Form-designer **SqlDatabase** control: the `Driver` property now labels
  generated comments as SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL (routing stays by
  connection string).

### Docs & tests

- New guide: `docs/database-runtime.md` (connection strings, CALL reference,
  value normalisation, transactions, TLS notes, testing).
- Tests: connection-string routing + value normalisation + in-memory SQLite CRUD
  (`db_runtime` unit tests, `test_sql.rs`), plus opt-in `#[ignore]`d live
  PostgreSQL/MySQL round-trips (`PRC_TEST_PG_URL` / `PRC_TEST_MYSQL_URL`).

### Notes

- The synchronous PostgreSQL driver connects without TLS (`NoTls`); see
  `docs/database-runtime.md` for the recommended TLS approach. The COBOL
  `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` verbs remain INDEXED-file transactions — use
  `COBOL-EXEC-SQL` with `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` for SQL.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.8.0] — 2026-06-05

Program-controlled `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` transactions for INDEXED files.

### New language features

- **`COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`** are now real COBOL verbs (reserved keyword tokens,
  so a preceding `DISPLAY` no longer absorbs them). They apply to **every** open
  INDEXED file in the run unit:
  - `OPEN` begins a transaction; `COMMIT` makes all changes durable and starts a
    new one; `ROLLBACK` undoes every `WRITE`/`REWRITE`/`DELETE` since the last
    `COMMIT`/`OPEN`; `CLOSE` persists (implicit commit).
  - The **memory engine**'s existing journal is now wired through.
  - The **disk engine** gained a real in-run **undo log** (Insert/Update/Delete
    inverses) — `ROLLBACK` was previously a no-op there.

### Notes

- This is *program-level* rollback; crash-recovery via a durable write-ahead log
  remains future work.
- New tests: `test_transactions` (disk + memory engines). Full suite: **382
  passed, 0 failed**.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.7.2] — 2026-06-05

File-sharing / locking phrases and `CANCEL` — previously parse errors or no-ops.

### New language features

- **`OPEN … [SHARING WITH {ALL OTHER | NO OTHER | READ ONLY}] [WITH LOCK]`** —
  parses and is honoured where meaningful (advisory in the single-run-unit model;
  no longer a parse error).
- **`READ … WITH [NO] LOCK` / `WITH KEPT LOCK`** — `WITH NO LOCK` releases the
  record lock the INDEXED engine takes under `I-O`.
- **`UNLOCK file [RECORD[S]]`** now releases the file's INDEXED record locks
  (new `IndexedStore::unlock`).
- **`CANCEL program …`** — was silently dropped at parse; now a real statement
  that re-initialises the named (nested) program's WORKING-STORAGE so the next
  `CALL` starts fresh.

### Notes

- New tests: `test_file_locking` (lock flow + CANCEL) and parser cases in
  `test_statements`. Full suite: **378 passed, 0 failed**.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.7.1] — 2026-06-05

Completes the previously recognized-but-no-op `ACCEPT` register sources.

### New language features

- **`ACCEPT … FROM COMMAND-LINE`** — the whole command line (arguments joined).
- **`ACCEPT … FROM ARGUMENT-NUMBER`** — the count of command-line arguments;
  **`DISPLAY n UPON ARGUMENT-NUMBER`** sets the argument pointer, and
  **`ACCEPT … FROM ARGUMENT-VALUE`** returns the argument at that pointer.
- **`ACCEPT … FROM ENVIRONMENT-VALUE`** — the value of the variable named by
  **`DISPLAY "name" UPON ENVIRONMENT-NAME`** (paired registers).
- **`ACCEPT … FROM ESCAPE KEY`** → `"00"`, **`FROM CRT STATUS`** → `"0000"`.
- The CLI passes a program's own arguments through (`rcrun run prog.cbl a b c`),
  and a compiled binary uses its real `argv`.

### Notes

- New test: `test_accept_sources`. Full suite: **373 passed, 0 failed**.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.7.0] — 2026-06-04

Avoid-list clearance: the remaining ⚠️/❌ items in the RustCOBOL-85 Supported
Syntax Reference are now implemented. The COBOL-85 verb/clause set is fully
covered. The IDE is unchanged.

### New language features

- **Identifier-object abbreviated conditions** — `a = b OR c` (where `c` is a
  data item) is resolved at runtime via the 88-level metadata (new
  `Condition::NameOrAbbrev`): a known condition-name evaluates as one, otherwise
  it is the abbreviation object `a = c`.
- **`INITIALIZE … REPLACING {ALPHABETIC|ALPHANUMERIC|NUMERIC|…-EDITED} [DATA] BY
  value`** — sets each subordinate item of that category; others untouched.
- **`66 RENAMES item-1 [THRU item-2]`** — a regrouping alias; reads synthesize
  the concatenated value, writes distribute by field width.
- **Pointers** — `USAGE POINTER`; `SET ptr TO {ADDRESS OF id | NULL | ptr2}`;
  `SET ADDRESS OF id TO {ptr | ADDRESS OF x | NULL}` (aliases `id` onto the
  target's storage — reads **and** writes follow it); `IF ptr = NULL`.
- **`ALTER para-1 TO [PROCEED TO] para-2`** redirects para-1's `GO TO`;
  **`UNLOCK file`** is a real statement (no-op in the auto-unlock model).
- **Faithful `NEXT SENTENCE`** — was never actually parsed; now recognized and
  it transfers control past the next sentence boundary (synthetic markers).
- **Remaining standard intrinsics** — `PRESENT-VALUE` (completes the COBOL-85
  set) plus `YEAR-TO-YYYY`, `BYTE-LENGTH`/`LENGTH-AN`, `NUMVAL-F`, `TEST-NUMVAL`.
- **Extended screen `ACCEPT`/`DISPLAY`** — `DISPLAY … AT {nnnn | LINE n COLUMN n}
  [WITH HIGHLIGHT|REVERSE-VIDEO|UNDERLINE]` and `ACCEPT … AT …` execute via ANSI
  cursor positioning + SGR in CLI mode (ignored in GUI mode — the designer
  supersedes SCREEN I/O there).

### Notes

- New tests: `test_pointers`, plus cases in `test_conditions`, `test_initialize`,
  `test_control_flow`, `test_intrinsics_date`, and `test_statements`. Full suite:
  **371 passed, 0 failed**.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.6.0] — 2026-06-04

A COBOL-85 verb-completeness pass: closing every remaining ⚠️/❌ item in the
RustCOBOL-85 Supported Syntax Reference. The IDE is unchanged.

### New language features

- **Multi-receiver `MULTIPLY`/`DIVIDE GIVING` + per-receiver `ROUNDED`** —
  `MULTIPLY a BY b GIVING r1 [ROUNDED] r2 …`, `DIVIDE … GIVING q1 [ROUNDED] q2 …
  [REMAINDER r]`, and per-receiver `ROUNDED` on `ADD`/`SUBTRACT`. (Also fixes
  `MULTIPLY a BY b` with no GIVING to store into `b`.)
- **`EXIT PERFORM [CYCLE]` / `EXIT PARAGRAPH` / `EXIT SECTION`** via control-flow
  signals; plain `EXIT` is now a no-op return point and `EXIT PROGRAM` returns to
  the caller (both were wrongly `STOP RUN`).
- **`CALL … NOT ON EXCEPTION`** — the body now runs when the call resolves.
- **`INSPECT … TALLYING … REPLACING`** combined (the REPLACING half was dropped)
  and **`BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL`** region qualifiers on every TALLYING/REPLACING
  phrase; TALLYING now accumulates onto its counter.
- **Date / financial intrinsics** — `INTEGER-OF-DATE`, `DATE-OF-INTEGER`,
  `INTEGER-OF-DAY`, `DAY-OF-INTEGER`, `FRACTION-PART`, `ANNUITY` (were `0`).
- **Literal-object abbreviated conditions** — `A = 1 OR 2 OR 3` reuses the
  subject and operator.
- **`EVALUATE … ALSO`** multi-subject (positional AND matching) and **`WHEN NOT`**.
- **Real 88-level condition-names** — the host item is tested against the
  declared VALUEs/ranges, and `SET 88-name TO TRUE/FALSE` writes a satisfying /
  violating value to the host (previously a bogus standalone slot).
- **`PERFORM para VARYING …`** now executes the named paragraph each iteration.
- **Functional `SORT` / `MERGE`** — `RELEASE`/`RETURN`, `USING`/`GIVING`, and
  `INPUT`/`OUTPUT PROCEDURE`, with stable sort by ASCENDING/DESCENDING keys.

### Notes

- `UNLOCK` and `ALTER` remain recognized no-ops (correct for the auto-unlock
  model; ALTER is deprecated). `66 RENAMES`, `INITIALIZE … REPLACING`, and
  identifier-object abbreviation remain unsupported (documented in the reference).
- New tests: `test_arith_receivers`, `test_control_flow`, `test_inspect`,
  `test_intrinsics_date`, `test_conditions`, `test_sort` (cobolt-runtime).

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.5.0] — 2026-06-04

Hierarchical / occurrence-aware runtime environment. One dedicated effort
unblocks four interrelated COBOL-85 capabilities that the flat data store
previously could not express. The IDE is unchanged.

### New language features

- **Runtime table subscripting** — `TABLE-ITEM(i)` (and multi-dimension
  `T(i, j)`) now read and write per-occurrence storage slots, materialised
  lazily from the item's template on first write. Variable subscripts
  (`T(WS-I)`) are evaluated each access.
- **Qualified-name disambiguation** — `data-item OF group` / `… IN group`
  now resolves to the correct item when a leaf name is **declared in more than
  one group**. Duplicated names are stored under path-qualified canonical keys,
  so `BALANCE OF ACCOUNT` and `BALANCE OF SUMMARY` are independent fields
  (previously they collided into one slot). Unique names are unaffected.
- **`MOVE CORRESPONDING g1 TO g2`** — moves each subordinate item that the two
  groups share by name, recursing through matching sub-groups; items present in
  only one group are untouched.
- **`ADD CORRESPONDING g1 TO g2 [ROUNDED]`** and
  **`SUBTRACT CORRESPONDING g1 FROM g2 [ROUNDED]`** — new
  `Stmt::AddCorresponding` / `Stmt::SubtractCorresponding`; combine each matching
  numeric pair, recursing through matching sub-groups.
- **Functional `SEARCH` / `SEARCH ALL`** — `Stmt::Search` now drives the table's
  index (the `VARYING` item, else its first `INDEXED BY` index) from its current
  value to the table bound, evaluating each `WHEN` per occurrence and running the
  first matching imperative, else the `AT END` body. `INDEXED BY` index-names are
  registered as numeric index registers (recognised by `SET` and the resolver).
- **`DISPLAY` of qualified & subscripted numerics** now renders with full PIC
  width (leading zeros), matching plain-item DISPLAY.

### Internal

- `CobolEnvironment` gains a per-item symbol table (`ItemSym`: OCCURS dims, child
  names + canonical child keys, ancestor path, INDEXED BY names) plus a
  duplicate-name index; `resolve_name()` maps a (name, qualifiers) reference to
  its canonical storage key.
- Tests: `crates/cobolt-runtime/tests/test_hierarchy.rs`.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.4.0] — 2026-06-04

A COBOL-85 language-coverage pass: closing parser/runtime gaps surfaced by the
verb test matrix. The IDE is unchanged.

### New language features

- **Reference modification** `data-item(start:[length])` — new `Expr::RefMod`,
  parsed on any operand (disambiguated from subscripts by the `:`), evaluated as
  a substring (sender) and as a spliced partial assignment (receiver).
- **`COMPUTE` multiple receivers + per-receiver `ROUNDED`** —
  `COMPUTE r1 [ROUNDED] r2 [ROUNDED] … = expr` (was single receiver, one flag).
- **Category-aware `INITIALIZE`** — new `Stmt::Initialize`; numeric / numeric-
  edited items reset to ZERO, everything else to SPACES, recursing into groups
  (was a blanket `MOVE SPACES`).
- **`STRING` / `UNSTRING … ON OVERFLOW` / `NOT ON OVERFLOW`** + the
  `END-STRING` / `END-UNSTRING` / `END-SEARCH` scope-terminator tokens (which also
  fixes `DISPLAY` greedily swallowing a following `END-*` word).
- **`SET idx {UP|DOWN} BY n`** (encoded as ADD / SUBTRACT).
- **Inline `PERFORM n TIMES … END-PERFORM`** (no paragraph).
- **Operator-prefixed abbreviated conditions** — `a > 1 AND < 9`, `a = 5 OR = 7`.
- **`CALL … ON EXCEPTION / ON OVERFLOW`** — the handler now runs when the called
  program is unresolved (was parsed and discarded).
- **Extended `ACCEPT` / `DISPLAY` screen forms recognized** — `AT nnnn`,
  `AT LINE n COLUMN n`, `WITH <attributes>`, and `ACCEPT FROM
  {ARGUMENT-NUMBER|ARGUMENT-VALUE|ENVIRONMENT-VALUE|ESCAPE KEY|CRT STATUS}` parse
  (not executed — SCREEN I/O is superseded by the designer).
- **`SEARCH` / `SEARCH ALL`, `RELEASE`, `RETURN`, `UNLOCK`, `ALTER`** are now
  recognized statements (parse as no-ops) instead of breaking the parse.
- **Intrinsic functions** expanded: `ORD`, `CHAR`, `ORD-MAX`, `ORD-MIN`, `SUM`,
  `MEAN`, `MEDIAN`, `MIDRANGE`, `RANGE`, `VARIANCE`, `STANDARD-DEVIATION`,
  `FACTORIAL`, `SIN`/`COS`/`TAN`/`ASIN`/`ACOS`/`ATAN`, `LOG`/`LOG10`,
  `EXP`/`EXP10`, `PI`, `STORED-CHAR-LENGTH`, `WHEN-COMPILED` (was: unknown
  functions returned 0).

### Known gaps (documented)

- `MOVE/ADD/SUBTRACT CORRESPONDING`, runtime **table subscript indexing**,
  **qualified-name disambiguation**, and **functional `SEARCH`** all await an
  occurrence-aware data model (the runtime store is currently flat).
- Multiple receivers on `MULTIPLY`/`DIVIDE`; per-receiver `ROUNDED` on
  `ADD`/`SUBTRACT`; `SET ADDRESS OF`; identifier-object abbreviated conditions.

### Docs

- New [`docs/cobol85-verb-test-matrix.md`](docs/cobol85-verb-test-matrix.md)
  (what to test) and [`docs/cobol85-supported-syntax.md`](docs/cobol85-supported-syntax.md)
  (the exact grammar RustCOBOL accepts, with an avoid-list). README updated.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.3.1] — 2026-06-04

File I/O fixes surfaced by the storage/compression File I/O test pack
(`tests/cobol/fileio/`), now run end-to-end in the suite.

### Fixes

- **Record `ORGANIZATION IS SEQUENTIAL` READ** — fixed-length records (no
  terminator) are now read one record (`record_len` bytes) per `READ`, dispatched
  by organization. Previously the reader used line reads for every sequential
  file, so the first `READ` of a record-sequential file consumed the whole file
  and subsequent reads hit EOF. (`interpreter.rs`)
- **Source is always free form.** `rcrun` no longer auto-detects fixed vs free;
  it treats source as free form (set `COBOLT_FIXED=1` to opt into fixed-form
  parsing). This keeps long `ASSIGN` paths / `DISPLAY` literals from being
  truncated at column 72.

### Grammar (final, lean)

- The INDEXED storage clause is **`STORAGE [MODE] IS MEMORY | DISK`** (`MODE`
  optional) and compression is **`WITH COMPRESSION`** — in the storage clause or
  as a standalone clause (which uses the default storage backend). The earlier
  `WITH COMPRESSION` spelling and other variations were removed to keep the
  grammar clean.

### Behaviour

- **Default storage is `DISK`.** When an INDEXED file has no `STORAGE` clause,
  it now uses the on-disk paged B+tree engine (was MEMORY). `STORAGE IS MEMORY`
  selects the in-RAM engine explicitly.
- Writing a record that creates a duplicate value on an `ALTERNATE RECORD KEY …
  WITH DUPLICATES` is now a fully successful `00` write (previously the
  informational `02`). `WITHOUT DUPLICATES` violations still return `22`.

### Tests

- The File I/O test pack is vendored under `tests/cobol/fileio/` (baseline
  `fileiot.cbl` + six storage/compression variants) and driven end-to-end by
  `crates/cobolt-runtime/tests/test_fileio_storage.rs` (ASSIGN paths redirected
  to a temp dir; the 1,000,000-record profile loop shrunk for speed — the
  original files keep the full 1M profile for manual `rcrun` benchmarking).
- The earlier `tests/cobol/indexed-files/` programs (idxbasic, idxstorage) were
  removed — the File I/O suite supersedes them with broader indexed coverage.
  Focused inline engine checks remain in `test_indexed.rs`.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.3.0] — 2026-06-04

INDEXED files gain a selectable storage backend and record compression.

### `STORAGE IS MEMORY | DISK` (new) + persistent on-disk B+tree

- **New SELECT clause** `STORAGE IS MEMORY | DISK [WITH COMPRESSION]`
  for INDEXED files (a PowerRustCOBOL extension). `ASSIGN TO` is still required —
  it is where the data is persisted. Parsed in `parse_file_control_entry`
  (`StorageMode` on `FileControl`); the parser now also recognises the spaced
  `ALTERNATE RECORD KEY … [WITH DUPLICATES]` form.
- **`MEMORY`** (default) — the existing in-RAM `BTreeMap` engine (whole file in
  memory, persisted to the `PRCIDX1` container on close).
- **`DISK`** — a new **persistent, paged on-disk B+tree engine**
  (`cobolt-runtime/src/indexed_disk.rs`, container `PRCIDXD1`): records and
  indexes live in the `ASSIGN` file and are read on demand, so RAM use is bounded
  by the page cache rather than the whole data set. Built from 4 KiB pages with
  a **free list** (freed pages reused), one **B+tree per key** (primary +
  alternates; variable byte-packed nodes, split on insert, doubly-linked leaves
  for `START` + `READ NEXT/PREVIOUS`), a **RecordId directory** (a record that
  moves on `REWRITE` only updates the directory, not every index), and **slotted
  data pages** with an overflow chain for oversized records. The full COBOL verb
  set works on it (`OPEN`/`WRITE`/`READ` random+sequential/`REWRITE`/`DELETE`/
  `START` with all key relations, `INVALID KEY`), with FILE STATUS 22/23/35/39.
  Index deletes are lazy (no node merge; data pages are reclaimed).
- Both backends share one `IndexedStore` trait, dispatched from
  `make_indexed_engine` by `STORAGE MODE`.

### `WITH COMPRESSION` (new)

- Optional `WITH COMPRESSION` compresses stored record data in **both**
  storage modes via a self-contained, **dependency-free** PackBits-style RLE
  (`cobolt-runtime/src/compress.rs`) chosen for maximum speed; a one-byte tag
  guarantees the output never grows. On the padded, fixed-length records typical
  of COBOL it compresses well past the 50 % target; incompressible blocks fall
  back to raw.

### Tests

- `compress.rs` (round-trip, ≥50 % on padded records, raw fallback, long runs),
  `indexed_disk.rs` (pager/free-list, B+tree splits over 2 000 records +
  persistence, all `START` relations, NEXT/PREVIOUS, alt keys with/without
  duplicates, REWRITE/DELETE, compression round-trip, status 35/39), and
  end-to-end COBOL `STORAGE IS DISK [WITH COMPRESSION]` programs in
  `tests/test_indexed.rs`.

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.2.0] — 2026-06-03

A COBOL-85 language milestone: exact numeric arithmetic, numeric-edited
PICTUREs, `COPY`/`REPLACE` copybooks, and a full **INDEXED (ISAM) file engine**.
The IDE interface is unchanged; all generated COBOL source stays in English.

### Indexed (ISAM) files — new

- **Built-in keyed-file engine** (`cobolt-runtime/src/indexed.rs`) — a
  dependency-free ISAM store: primary `RECORD KEY` plus
  `ALTERNATE RECORD KEY [WITH DUPLICATES]`, records held in ascending key order,
  a journaled write log with `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`, and record locking. No
  external libraries.
- **Self-describing `PRCIDX1` container** — the on-disk format now embeds the
  full file schema (record format + every key's byte-ranged composite parts,
  encoding, ordering, duplicate policy, and COBOL field name) plus timestamps
  and a CRC-32 trailer, modelled on Fujitsu's `cobfa_indexinfo()` metadata so a
  future Fujitsu importer can write faithful files. The legacy records-only
  `PRCISAM1` container is still read (and upgraded to `PRCIDX1` on next write).
  - **Discovery API** `IndexedFile::inspect_path()` reads a file's schema
    (`IndexedFileInfo`) without opening it for I/O.
  - **Strict open-time validation**: declared `SELECT`/`FD` keys + record format
    are checked against the stored schema → FILE STATUS **39** on mismatch;
    `OPEN INPUT` of a missing file → **35**; corrupt container (CRC) → **90**.
  - Format documented in [`docs/indexed-file-format.md`](docs/indexed-file-format.md).
- **Verbs dispatched by `ORGANIZATION`.** `OPEN` / `CLOSE` / `READ` / `WRITE`
  are wired to each file's declared organization (from its `SELECT`), not a
  single hard-coded type, so SEQUENTIAL / LINE SEQUENTIAL / INDEXED share the
  common verbs while each keeps its own semantics. (`interpreter.rs`,
  `cobolt-runtime/src/files.rs` `RecordLayout` materialize/distribute.)
- **Indexed verb set executes**: `OPEN INPUT/OUTPUT/I-O/EXTEND`,
  `WRITE`, random `READ` by `RECORD KEY`, `READ … NEXT / PREVIOUS`
  (sequential), `REWRITE`, `DELETE`, and `START … KEY IS = / > / >= / < / <=`
  (incl. `GREATER/LESS THAN`, `NOT LESS THAN`).
- **`ACCESS MODE SEQUENTIAL / RANDOM / DYNAMIC`** now all execute (an
  unqualified `READ` is random under RANDOM/DYNAMIC; `NEXT/PREVIOUS` force
  sequential).
- **`INVALID KEY` / `NOT INVALID KEY`** phrases added to `READ`/`WRITE`/
  `REWRITE`/`DELETE`/`START`, alongside full **FILE STATUS** codes
  (00/02/10/22/23/…).
- **Selectable engine** — `rcrun --indexed-engine <rust|rm-cobol85|fujitsu>`
  (or `-I`) and the `COBOL_INDEXED_ENGINE` environment variable choose the ISAM
  engine. All engines are behaviour-compatible; `rust` is the default and
  `rm-cobol85` / `fujitsu` currently delegate to it pending their native
  container formats.
- Verified by the File I/O suite [`tests/cobol/fileio/`](tests/cobol/fileio/)
  plus `cobolt-runtime` integration and unit tests.

### Exact numeric arithmetic

- `ADD` / `SUBTRACT` / `MULTIPLY` / `DIVIDE` / `COMPUTE` run on an `i128`
  fixed-point mantissa (no `f64` round-trips): exact to 18-digit standard and
  31-digit extended precision, with `ROUNDED` (half away from zero) and
  `ON SIZE ERROR` / `NOT ON SIZE ERROR`. Decimal literals are carried exactly
  from the lexer. Numeric `DISPLAY` renders at full PIC width.
  Verified by [`tests/cobol/numeric-precision/numprec.cbl`](tests/cobol/numeric-precision/numprec.cbl).

### Numeric-edited PICTUREs

- Edit engine (`cobolt-runtime/src/numedit.rs`): `Z` suppression, `*`
  check-protection, fixed/floating `$` and `+`/`-`, `,`/`.` insertion,
  `B`/`0`/`/` insertion, and `CR`/`DB`, applied on `MOVE`/`DISPLAY` into an
  edited field.
- **`DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA`** — comma decimal separator for literals and the
  swapped `.`/`,` roles in edited PICs.
  Verified by [`tests/cobol/numeric-edited-pic/`](tests/cobol/numeric-edited-pic/).

### COPY / REPLACE copybooks

- Preprocessor (`cobolt-runtime/src/copybook.rs`) expands
  `COPY name [OF lib] [REPLACING ==a== BY ==b== …]` (pseudo-text + word
  replacement), resolves copybooks beside the source, expands nested `COPY`
  recursively, and applies `REPLACE … BY …` / `REPLACE OFF`.
  Verified by [`tests/cobol/copy-replace/`](tests/cobol/copy-replace/).

### Tests

- `tests/cobol/` reorganized into per-purpose subfolders
  (`numeric-precision/`, `numeric-edited-pic/`, `copy-replace/`,
  `indexed-files/`).

## [PowerRustCOBOL 1.1.0] — 2026-06-01

### Form Designer & rendering

- **New widget: Animator.** Plays animated images — **GIF, WebP and APNG** (and
  any still image) — decoded natively via the `image` crate (no external/FFmpeg
  dependency). Properties: `Source`, `AutoPlay`, `Loop`, `SizeMode`
  (Fit/Fill/Stretch/Center), back/border. Decoding + frame-timed egui playback
  live in the new shared `cobolt-media` crate, so the widget animates in the
  designer canvas, the preview, the run-form **and** the compiled standalone
  binary. (MP4 support is planned via a native decoder behind the same API.)


- **System font picker** — the Font property is now a dropdown of the fonts
  installed on the machine (via `fontdb`), each name rendered **in its own
  font**. The list is virtualised, so only the families you actually scroll
  past are loaded. The chosen font **family and size** are now applied to the
  rendered text in the **designer canvas, preview window and run form**, with a
  graceful fallback to the built-in (Arial-like) proportional font when a family
  is Arial/default or unavailable on the target system. Bitmap-only faces (e.g.
  `GB18030 Bitmap`) that egui can't rasterise are rejected up-front, fixing a
  crash when scrolling the font list. (`cobolt-ide/src/fonts.rs`)

- **#69 — Resize the form canvas by dragging its border.** Right, bottom and
  bottom-right corner grips; live resize with grid snap and a minimum size.
  (`designer.rs`)

- **#70 — Double-click an event row to jump to its COBOL paragraph.** The
  generated `.cbl` is opened in the editor and scrolled to the paragraph (or
  `PROGRAM-ID`) definition. Single-click still opens the per-event modal editor.
  (`properties.rs`, `app.rs`, `editor.rs`; i18n key `hint_dblclick_event`)

- **#129 — Preview animations now apply `scale`.** Zoom/spin/flip animations
  resize widgets in the preview window, via the shared
  `designer::scale_rect_about_center()` (also used by the canvas). (`app.rs`)

### Runtime / language

- **COBOL sequential file I/O — `ORGANIZATION IS SEQUENTIAL` and
  `LINE SEQUENTIAL`.** The ENVIRONMENT DIVISION's `FILE-CONTROL` is now parsed
  (`SELECT … ASSIGN TO … ORGANIZATION IS [LINE] SEQUENTIAL [ACCESS MODE …]
  [FILE STATUS IS …]`), and the runtime implements `OPEN INPUT/OUTPUT/EXTEND/I-O`,
  `WRITE record [FROM …]`, `READ file [INTO …] [AT END …] [NOT AT END …]`, and
  `CLOSE`, updating the FILE STATUS item (00/10/30/35/…). LINE SEQUENTIAL writes
  newline-terminated records (trailing spaces dropped); record SEQUENTIAL writes
  fixed-length records. `ASSIGN TO` accepts a literal path or a data item holding
  the path. `READ … AT END` accepts the two-word `AT END` / `NOT AT END` forms.
  (`cobolt-ast`, `cobolt-parser`, `cobolt-runtime`)

- **New built-in CALLs `COBOL-APPEND-FILE` / `COBOL-WRITE-FILE`** —
  `USING path text [status]` append a line to (or truncate+write) a text file.
  COBOL `OPEN/WRITE` file I/O is still unimplemented; these cover the common
  "write a results/log file" need. (`interpreter.rs`)

- **PICTURE repetition counts are now honored.** `analyze_pic` ignored `(n)`, so
  `PIC X(20)` held 1 char and `PIC 9(5)` had 1 digit. Templates are now expanded
  (`X(20)`→20, `9(7)V99`→7.2), and `PicClause.digits/decimals` widened to `u16`
  so wide fields like `PIC X(4096)` / `PIC X(32767)` are exact. (`cobolt-parser`,
  `cobolt-ast`)

- **Alphanumeric comparison pads with spaces.** `compare_values` compared raw
  strings, so a space-padded `PIC X(64)` field never equalled a short literal
  (e.g. `EVALUATE control-id WHEN "BTN-OK"` never matched). The shorter operand
  is now space-padded per COBOL rules. (`interpreter.rs`)

- **`STRING … DELIMITED BY SIZE` works.** The bare word `SIZE` lexes to the
  `SizeError` token (reserved for ON SIZE ERROR); the STRING parser now accepts
  it as the SIZE delimiter, so `STRING` no longer dropped all operands.
  (`cobolt-parser`)

### Compiler (standalone binary)

- **Richer Label rendering in the generated form app.** The compiled binary's
  Label now honors BackColor, ForeColor, FontSize, Bold/Italic/Underline/
  Strikethrough, TextAlign, WordWrap, Padding, Opacity, BorderStyle/BorderColor,
  Cursor (on hover), per-control geometry overrides (`X/Y/Width/Height`) and
  `Dock` from `COBOL-SET-PROPERTY`, plus a short input warm-up so a click already
  underway as the window opens can't trigger a control. (`cobolt-compiler`)

### Fixes

- Fixed a long-broken `cobolt-codegen` test target (ambiguous `.into()` in
  `Control::new` calls) and corrected stale form-event paragraph-name
  expectations (`MAIN-FORM--ONLOAD`, not `--ON-LOAD`).

- **Lexer — fixed-form identification area now stripped.** `flatten_fixed` /
  `preprocess_fixed` were slicing active source out to char-column 255 instead
  of 72, so anything a program placed in columns 73–80 (the identification area)
  leaked into the token stream. Now correctly cut at column 72. (`source.rs`)

- **Lexer — `END-PERFORM` is a scope-terminator keyword.** Corrected stale tests
  that asserted it should be an identifier; the keyword table and parser have
  always treated it as `Token::EndPerform` (like `END-IF` / `END-EVALUATE`).

- **Parser — sequential program units in one file are no longer dropped.**
  `parse_program` now collects sibling program units that follow the first
  program's `END PROGRAM` terminator (e.g. `OUTER. … END PROGRAM OUTER.` then
  `SET-RESULT. … END PROGRAM SET-RESULT.`) into `nested_programs`, so the runtime
  can `CALL` them. True nesting (inner units before the outer terminator, the
  codegen shape) is unchanged. Fixes all 6 `cobolt-runtime` nested-program tests.
  New regression tests in `cobolt-parser/tests/test_nested_programs.rs`.

### Tests

- Added unit/behavioural tests: `fonts::tests` (enumeration, fallback, on-demand
  load, bitmap rejection), `designer::form_resize_tests`,
  `designer::anim_behavior_tests::scale_rect_…`, and `editor::goto_tests`.
  `cargo test -p cobolt-ide` → 35 passing.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-30

### Phase 11 — Embed+Bundle Binary Compiler

Cobolt projects can now be compiled into a **single self-contained native
executable** with no source code included.  The output binary embeds the
compressed AST and all form files, then runs them through the existing
interpreter at launch.

#### New crate: `cobolt-compiler`

The core build pipeline lives in `crates/cobolt-compiler/src/lib.rs`:

1. **Load manifest** — reads `cobolt.toml`, resolves main source + additional
   sources + form files.
2. **Lex → parse → semantic** — validates all COBOL sources; aborts on any
   error so only correct programs are compiled.
3. **Serialize + compress** — the `Program` AST is serialised with `bincode`
   and deflate-compressed with `flate2` (best compression).  Typical savings:
   60–75% smaller than raw bincode.
4. **Generate build project** — writes a temporary Cargo project to
   `/tmp/cobolt-build-<name>/` containing:
   - `Cargo.toml` — depends on `cobolt-runtime`, `cobolt-forms`, `eframe`/`egui`
     via path references to the local workspace.
   - `src/main.rs` — embeds assets via `include_bytes!`, contains a lazy form
     dispatch table, and launches either a headless interpreter or an eframe
     form application depending on whether forms are present.
   - `assets/program.bin` — compressed AST.
   - `assets/forms/<ID>.cfrm` — raw form XML for each form.
5. **`cargo build --release`** — compiles the generated project to a native binary.
6. **Copy to `bin/`** — the executable is placed at
   `<project-root>/bin/<project-name>` (`bin/<name>.exe` on Windows) with
   executable permissions set on Unix.

New workspace dependencies: `bincode = "1"`, `flate2 = "1"`.

#### Lazy form loader

The generated binary contains a `static FORMS: &[(&str, &[u8])]` dispatch
table.  A form is only deserialised from its embedded bytes when first
requested by the running COBOL program, keeping startup time constant
regardless of how many forms the project contains.

#### `cobolt build` CLI command

```
cobolt build [cobolt.toml] [--quiet]
```

Calls `cobolt_compiler::build_project()` and prints a summary on success:

```
✅ Build complete!
   Binary : myapp/bin/myapp
   Sources: 3
   Forms  : 2
   AST    : 8 412 bytes (compressed)
```

#### IDE — 🔨 Build Binary menu item

`File → 🔨 Build Binary (bin/)` triggers `do_build_binary()`, which:
- Spawns the compiler on a background thread (IDE stays responsive).
- Shows a ⏳ spinner label while building.
- Prints the binary path and stats in the Output panel when done.
- Shows an error message if the build fails.

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-30

### Phase 10 — REST Client Runtime

COBOL programs can now make real HTTP requests — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE — using
standard `CALL` statements handled entirely inside the interpreter.  No external
tools, FFI, or async runtime are required.

#### New dependency: `ureq` (`cobolt-runtime/Cargo.toml`)

`ureq = { version = "2", features = ["json"] }` — a minimal blocking HTTP
client with built-in TLS support.  No async executor is pulled in.

#### New: `HttpClient` (`cobolt-runtime/src/http_runtime.rs`)

`HttpClient` manages per-session HTTP state for the interpreter:

- `get(url) -> (body, status)` — HTTP GET; returns the response body and
  numeric status code.  On network failure status is `0`.
- `post(url, body) -> (body, status)` — HTTP POST; Content-Type defaults to
  `application/json` unless overridden by `set_header`.
- `put(url, body) -> (body, status)` — HTTP PUT with the same body semantics.
- `delete(url) -> (body, status)` — HTTP DELETE.
- `set_header(name, value)` — adds / overwrites a persistent header sent on
  every subsequent request.
- `clear_headers()` — removes all persistent headers.

All methods strip trailing COBOL spaces from URL and body arguments before
sending.

#### Updated: `Interpreter` — 6 HTTP built-in `CALL` handlers

An `http: HttpClient` field is now part of `Interpreter` (initialised in
`new()`, inherited by `new_with_debug_channels()`).  `exec_call()` handles:

| CALL name                  | Arguments (BY REFERENCE)                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `COBOL-HTTP-GET`           | url-var, response-var, status-var                 |
| `COBOL-HTTP-POST`          | url-var, body-var, response-var, status-var        |
| `COBOL-HTTP-PUT`           | url-var, body-var, response-var, status-var        |
| `COBOL-HTTP-DELETE`        | url-var, response-var, status-var                 |
| `COBOL-HTTP-SET-HEADER`    | name-var, value-var                               |
| `COBOL-HTTP-CLEAR-HEADERS` | (no arguments)                                    |

`response-var` receives the full response body (truncated by the `PIC X(32767)`
declaration if needed).  `status-var` (PIC 9(4)) receives the HTTP status code.

#### Updated: Codegen REST stubs (`cobolt-codegen/src/lib.rs`)

The working-storage section for `RestClient` controls no longer uses INVOKE /
OO-style comments.  Generated variables are now:

```cobol
01 WS-REQUEST-URL        PIC X(2048)  VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-REQUEST-BODY       PIC X(32767) VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-HTTP-RESPONSE      PIC X(32767) VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-HTTP-STATUS        PIC 9(4)     VALUE 0.
01 WS-HTTP-HEADER-NAME   PIC X(128)   VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-HTTP-HEADER-VALUE  PIC X(512)   VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-JSON-KEY           PIC X(256)   VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-JSON-VALUE         PIC X(4096)  VALUE SPACES.
```

`write_rest_client_stubs()` now generates three CALL-based paragraphs per
RestClient control (replacing the `INVOKE`-based stubs):

- **`{ID}-GET`** — `CALL "COBOL-HTTP-GET"` with url, response, and status;
  dispatches to the response or error handler paragraph based on the status code.
- **`{ID}-POST`** — `CALL "COBOL-HTTP-POST"` with url, body, response, status.
- **`{ID}-PUT`** — `CALL "COBOL-HTTP-PUT"` with url, body, response, status.
- Response / error handler stub paragraphs are generated for each control.
- An optional `{ID}-SYNC-ITEMS` paragraph copies `WS-HTTP-RESPONSE` and
  `WS-HTTP-STATUS` into user-configured `ResponseDataItem` / `StatusDataItem`
  data fields.

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-30

### Phase 9 — Project Packaging

Cobolt projects can now be bundled into a self-contained, runnable zip archive
both from the IDE and from the command line.

#### New: `cobolt package` CLI command (`cobolt-cli/src/main.rs`)

```
cobolt package [cobolt.toml] [--output path.zip]
```

- Reads a `cobolt.toml` project manifest (defaults to `./cobolt.toml`).
- Packs all tracked source files, forms, and assets with their relative paths
  preserved inside the archive.
- Generates a `run.sh` (Unix, executable) and `run.bat` (Windows) launcher
  so users can run the project without knowing `cobolt` CLI syntax.
- Generates a `README.txt` with installation instructions.
- If a `cobolt` / `cobolt.exe` binary is found next to the currently running
  executable it is automatically bundled, making the archive fully self-contained.
- `--output` / `-o` flag overrides the default output path (`<name>.zip`).
- Prints per-file progress, warnings for missing files, and a final summary.

New dependencies added to `cobolt-cli/Cargo.toml`:
`serde = { workspace = true }`, `toml = { workspace = true }`,
`zip = { version = "2", features = ["deflate"] }`.

#### New: `package_project()` (`cobolt-ide/src/project_model.rs`)

The same packaging logic is available as a library function consumed by the IDE:

- `package_project(project, project_dir, output_zip) -> Result<usize, ProjectError>`
  — packs all tracked files + launchers + README; returns the count of archived items.
- `find_cobolt_binary()` — looks for the runtime binary next to the IDE executable.

#### Updated: IDE — File → Package Project menu item

`CoboltApp::do_package_project()` wires the menu entry to `package_project()`:

- Opens a native Save dialog pre-filled with `<project-name>.zip`.
- Requires a project to be open; otherwise shows a helpful status message.
- Reports the file count and output path in the Output panel on success.

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-30

### Phase 8 — Database Runtime Engine

COBOL programs can now open real SQLite databases, execute SQL, and iterate
over result sets — all from standard `CALL` statements.  No host-language
embedding or FFI required.

#### New dependency: `rusqlite` (`cobolt-runtime/Cargo.toml`)

`rusqlite = { version = "0.31", features = ["bundled"] }` — SQLite is compiled
in from source; no system library or external install is needed.

#### New: `DbConn` and `DbRegistry` (`cobolt-runtime/src/db_runtime.rs`)

`DbConn` wraps a `rusqlite::Connection` and a cached result-set cursor:

- `open(conn_str)` — accepts a bare file path, `sqlite:<path>`, or `:memory:`.
- `exec(sql)` — auto-detects `SELECT`/`WITH`/`PRAGMA` vs. DML.  SELECT results
  are cached as `Vec<Vec<String>>`; DML returns the affected-row count.
- `fetch_col(col)` — returns column `col` (1-based) of the current row.
- `next_row()` — advances the cursor; returns `false` when exhausted.
- `row_count()` / `is_exhausted()` — query result-set metadata.

`DbRegistry` manages all open connections for one interpreter instance as a
`HashMap<u32, DbConn>` keyed by integer *handle*:

- `open(conn_str) -> u32` — opens a connection and returns its handle.
- `exec(handle, sql)`, `fetch_col(handle, col)`, `next_row(handle)`,
  `row_count(handle)`, `is_exhausted(handle)`, `close(handle)`, `close_all()`.

#### Updated: `Interpreter` — 6 SQL built-in `CALL` handlers

A `db: DbRegistry` field is now part of `Interpreter`.  `exec_call()` handles
six new built-in names (matched case-insensitively):

| CALL name            | Arguments (BY REFERENCE)                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `COBOL-OPEN-DB`      | conn-string, handle-var (PIC 9(9)), status-var (PIC X)    |
| `COBOL-EXEC-SQL`     | handle, query, row-count-var, status-var                  |
| `COBOL-FETCH-ROW`    | handle, col-index (1-based), dest-var, status-var         |
| `COBOL-NEXT-ROW`     | handle, more-flag-var (`Y`/`N`)                           |
| `COBOL-ROW-COUNT`    | handle, count-var                                         |
| `COBOL-CLOSE-DB`     | handle                                                    |

On interpreter shutdown (`send_debug_finished`) `db.close_all()` is called
to release all connections.

#### Updated: Codegen SQL stubs (`cobolt-codegen/src/lib.rs`)

Working-storage for `SqlDatabase` controls no longer uses `USAGE IS OBJECT`
items.  The generated variables are now:

```cobol
01 WS-{ID}-CONN-STRING   PIC X(512)   VALUE ':memory:'.
01 WS-{ID}-HANDLE        PIC 9(9)     VALUE 0.
01 WS-{ID}-STATUS        PIC X(512)   VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-SQL-QUERY           PIC X(4096)  VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-SQL-ERROR            PIC X(512)   VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-SQL-ROW-COUNT        PIC 9(9)     VALUE 0.
01 WS-SQL-COL-INDEX        PIC 9(4)     VALUE 1.
01 WS-SQL-CURRENT-VALUE    PIC X(512)   VALUE SPACES.
01 WS-SQL-MORE             PIC X(1)     VALUE 'N'.
```

`write_sql_stubs()` generates four CALL-based paragraphs per control:

- **`{ID}-CONNECT`** — `CALL "COBOL-OPEN-DB"` with conn-string, handle, status.
- **`{ID}-EXEC`** — `CALL "COBOL-EXEC-SQL"` with handle, query, row-count,
  status; initialises `WS-SQL-MORE` to `'Y'`.
- **`{ID}-FETCH-ALL`** — loops `PERFORM UNTIL WS-SQL-MORE = 'N'` calling
  `COBOL-FETCH-ROW` for each column index and `COBOL-NEXT-ROW` to advance.
- **`{ID}-CLOSE`** — `CALL "COBOL-CLOSE-DB"` with handle.

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-30

### Phase 7 — Debugger

The IDE now has a full interactive debugger for COBOL programs.

#### New: `DebugCmd` and `DebugEvent` channel types (`cobolt-runtime/src/debugger.rs`)

Two typed enums cross the thread boundary between the IDE and the interpreter:

- **`DebugCmd`** — `Continue`, `StepOver`, `Pause` — sent from the IDE to the
  interpreter to control execution.
- **`DebugEvent`** — `Paused { line, col, paragraph, vars }`, `Resumed`,
  `Finished` — sent from the interpreter back to the IDE.
- **`Breakpoints`** (`Arc<Mutex<HashSet<u32>>>`) — a thread-safe shared set of
  active breakpoint line numbers, written by the IDE and read by the interpreter.

#### Updated: `Interpreter` — per-statement debug hook

`Interpreter::new_with_debug_channels()` is a new constructor that wires the
debug channels into the interpreter.  Before every statement `exec_stmts()` now
calls `debug_check()`, which:

1. Extracts the statement's source line via `Stmt::span()`.
2. Checks whether the line matches a breakpoint **or** `debug_stepping` is true
   (StepOver mode).
3. If a pause condition is met, sends `DebugEvent::Paused` with a complete
   variable snapshot (`CobolEnvironment::iter()` → `VarSnapshot` list) and
   **blocks** on `debug_cmd_rx.recv()` until the IDE sends `Continue` or
   `StepOver`.
4. An async `Pause` command is handled via a non-blocking `try_recv()` poll on
   every statement when not already paused.
5. `DebugEvent::Finished` is sent when `run()` exits normally or via STOP RUN.

`current_paragraph` is updated as each paragraph is entered, so the Paused event
always carries the correct paragraph name.

#### New: `DebugRunner` (`cobolt-ide/src/runner.rs`)

`DebugRunner` is a sister to `Runner` that manages one debug session:

- `start(file_name, source)` — runs the full lex → parse → semantic pipeline,
  then spawns `Interpreter::new_with_debug_channels()` in a background thread.
- `send_cmd(DebugCmd)` — forwards a step/continue/pause command to the thread.
- `drain_events() -> Vec<DebugEvent>` — collects pending debug events each frame.
- `drain_run() -> Vec<RunMsg>` — collects pending run messages (diagnostics,
  output, finished).
- `pub breakpoints: Breakpoints` — the IDE writes breakpoint lines here before
  calling `start()`; the shared pointer is passed directly to the interpreter.
- `stop()` — drops `cmd_tx` (which unblocks any `recv()` in the interpreter,
  causing `Err(_)` → `StopRun`), then joins the thread.

#### New: Debugger side panel (`cobolt-ide/src/panels/debugger.rs`)

`DebuggerPanel` renders in a resizable right-side panel while a debug session
is active:

- **Step toolbar** — ▶ Continue (F5), ⤵ Step Over (F10), ⏸ Pause.  Buttons
  are disabled when the interpreter is running (not paused).
- **Location indicator** — paragraph name and source line, with a colour-coded
  ● Running / ● Paused status indicator.
- **Variable watch table** — displays all `CobolEnvironment` data items as
  a two-column striped grid (name / value), searchable via a filter text box.

#### New: Breakpoint gutter in editor.rs

The code editor's line-number column is now a fully interactive breakpoint
gutter:

- **Click** any line number to toggle a red breakpoint circle (●) on that line.
- When the debugger pauses, a **yellow arrow (→)** and highlighted row mark the
  current execution line.
- `EditorPanel::breakpoints: HashMap<PathBuf, HashSet<u32>>` stores active
  breakpoints per file.
- `breakpoints_for(path)` returns the line set for a given file, used by
  `do_debug()` to initialise the shared `Breakpoints` before starting the session.

#### New: 🐛 Debug toolbar button and keyboard shortcuts

A secondary toolbar strip appears below the main toolbar:

- **🐛 Debug** — starts a debug session for the active file (disabled while a
  normal run is active).  Automatically syncs breakpoints from the editor gutter
  into `DebugRunner::breakpoints` before starting.
- **■ Stop Debug** — drops the command channel (graceful stop), resets the
  debugger panel, and clears the editor debug-line highlight.
- **F5** — Continue (while a session is active).
- **F10** — Step Over (while a session is active).

#### i18n additions (all 5 languages)

New keys: `panel_debugger`, `dbg_continue`, `dbg_step_over`, `dbg_pause`,
`dbg_stop`, `dbg_variables`, `dbg_filter_hint`, `dbg_debug`.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-29

### Phase 6 — Form Runtime Engine

Forms can now be **executed interactively** from inside the IDE.  Pressing the
new **▶ Run Form** button in the designer toolbar compiles the form's generated
COBOL and runs it in a live, interactive OS window — no external tools required.

#### New: `FormEvent` and `StateUpdate` channel types (`cobolt-runtime`)

`crates/cobolt-runtime/src/channels.rs` introduces two typed messages that cross
the thread boundary between the egui UI and the background interpreter:

- **`FormEvent`** — sent from the UI thread to the interpreter when the user
  interacts with a control (`click()`, `change()`, `got_focus()`, `lost_focus()`).
  A special `quit()` sentinel (`ctrl_id = "__QUIT__"`) is used to unblock and
  terminate the interpreter cleanly.
- **`StateUpdate`** — sent from the interpreter to the UI whenever
  `COBOL-SET-PROPERTY` executes, carrying `ctrl_id`, `prop`, and `value` so the
  UI can update the live control snapshot immediately.

#### Updated: `Interpreter` — GUI channel support

`Interpreter::new_with_channels()` is a new constructor that wires three
`mpsc` channels into the interpreter for GUI-mode execution:

- `event_rx: Receiver<FormEvent>` — **`COBOL-WAIT-EVENT`** now _blocks_ on this
  receiver instead of immediately setting `COBOL-QUIT = 1`, enabling a real COBOL
  event loop.  Receiving the quit sentinel sets `COBOL-QUIT = 1` and exits.
- `state_tx: Sender<StateUpdate>` — **`COBOL-SET-PROPERTY`** sends a
  `StateUpdate` through this channel in addition to writing to the ObjectRegistry,
  so property changes are reflected in the UI on the next frame.
- `display_tx: Sender<String>` — **`DISPLAY`** statements route their output
  through this channel instead of stdout when in GUI mode; the IDE output panel
  receives each line via `OutputPanel::push_line()`.

CLI-mode behaviour (channels `None`) is completely unchanged.

#### New: `FormRuntime` (`cobolt-ide`)

`crates/cobolt-ide/src/form_runtime.rs` manages one live COBOL form execution:

- `FormRuntime::launch(form, form_path)` — generates COBOL from the form model,
  lexes, parses, and runs semantic analysis, then spawns
  `Interpreter::new_with_channels()` in a background thread.  Returns `Err` if
  parse or semantic analysis fails, displaying the errors in the output panel.
- `send_event(FormEvent)` — forwards a UI event to the interpreter thread.
- `drain_state() -> bool` — drains all pending `StateUpdate` messages and applies
  them to the `ctrl_state` snapshot; returns `true` when the UI should repaint.
- `drain_display() -> Vec<String>` — collects all `DISPLAY` lines produced since
  the last frame.
- `is_running() -> bool` — checks whether the interpreter thread is still alive.
- `stop()` — sends the quit sentinel and joins the thread.
- `Drop` impl ensures `stop()` is always called when the runtime is released.

Two supporting types are also defined here:

- **`CtrlMeta`** — immutable snapshot of a control's type, rect, z-order, and
  animations (populated at launch and used only for rendering order).
- **`CtrlState`** — mutable per-control state (`props`, `visible`, `enabled`),
  updated in-place by `drain_state()`.

#### New: **▶ Run Form** / **■ Stop Form** toolbar button

The designer toolbar now shows a **▶ Run Form** button when the form is not
running, and a **■ Stop Form** button while a runtime is active for that form.

- **▶ Run Form** saves the form, calls `FormRuntime::launch()`, and adds the
  runtime to `CoboltApp::form_runtimes`.
- **■ Stop Form** calls `stop()` on the matching runtime and removes it from the
  list.
- Multiple forms can run simultaneously in separate windows.

#### New: live interactive form viewport (`show_running_form_window`)

Each running `FormRuntime` gets its own OS window via `show_viewport_immediate`.
Every frame:

1. `drain_display()` output is forwarded to the IDE output panel.
2. `drain_state()` applies property updates to the live snapshot.
3. Controls are rendered in `z_order` from `ctrl_state` — buttons, labels,
   text boxes, checkboxes, combo boxes, list boxes, sliders, progress bars, and
   image controls are all handled.
4. User interactions fire the corresponding `FormEvent` back to the interpreter
   (`Click`, `Change`, `GotFocus`, `LostFocus`).
5. Non-visual controls (Timer, AgentObject, SqlDatabase, RestClient) are skipped.
6. Closing the window sends `FormEvent::quit()`, which unblocks
   `COBOL-WAIT-EVENT` and terminates the interpreter thread cleanly.

`ctx.request_repaint()` is called every frame while any form runtime is active,
ensuring the UI stays responsive to interpreter-driven state changes.

#### Output panel — `push_line()`

`OutputPanel::push_line(impl Into<String>)` was added to accept plain DISPLAY
output routed from the form runtime engine, displayed in the same monospace
light-grey style as normal program output.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-29

### New features & fixes

#### Form Designer — Save-on-close guard

Closing a dirty form designer window (one with unsaved changes) now triggers a
**Save / Discard / Cancel** confirmation dialog instead of silently discarding work:

- When the user clicks the OS close button (×) on a designer viewport that has
  unsaved changes, `ViewportCommand::CancelClose` is sent back to the OS to
  prevent the window from disappearing immediately
- A centred modal dialog appears with three choices:
  - **💾 Save & Close** — saves the `.cfrm` file and regenerates the `.cbl` COBOL
    source, then closes the window
  - **🗑 Discard & Close** — closes the window without saving
  - **Cancel** — dismisses the dialog, leaving the designer open and unchanged
- Closing via the dialog's own × button is treated as Cancel
- Clean (non-dirty) windows still close immediately without prompting

#### Form Designer — Save always regenerates COBOL

The **💾 Save** button in the designer toolbar now saves the `.cfrm` form file
**and** regenerates the `.cbl` COBOL source in a single action, keeping both files
in sync at all times.  The hover tooltip reads "Save form and regenerate COBOL".

Previously, Save only wrote the `.cfrm`; the user had to click "⚙ Generate COBOL"
separately to update the COBOL output.

#### Form Designer — Cmd+S in the designer window

**Cmd+S** (or Ctrl+S on Windows/Linux) now works inside designer viewport windows,
triggering the same save + regenerate action as the toolbar button.  Previously
Cmd+S was only handled in the main code-editor window and had no effect when the
designer was focused.

#### Properties panel — SqlDatabase `AutoConnect` type fix

`AutoConnect` was being pushed as `PropValue::String("true"/"false")` instead of
`PropValue::Bool(true/false)`.  The checkbox read the value back via `as_bool()`,
which checks for the `Bool` variant, so toggling `AutoConnect` had no effect.
Fixed: `PropValue::Bool(v)` is now used.

#### Properties panel — SqlDatabase COBOL Data Items grid layout

The "SQL Database — COBOL Data Items" section used an `egui::Grid` with
`num_columns(2)` but each `text_row_hint` call adds only one cell (a horizontal
layout containing both label and field).  The cells were therefore shifted by half
a column, causing labels and text edits to land in the wrong positions.  Fixed by:

- Changing the grid to `num_columns(1)` (each item gets its own full-width row)
- Adding `ui.end_row()` after each of the five `text_row_hint` calls
  (ConnDataItem, ResultSetDataItem, ConnectPara, QueryCompletePara, ErrorPara)

The same missing `ui.end_row()` was also present for the `ConnectionString` row
inside the "SQL Database — Connection" grid; that is fixed too.

#### Format painter — geometry copy

**Copy Style / Paste Style** (🖌 Format Painter) now also copies the source
control's position and size (X, Y, Width, Height) to the target control.

- `FormatPainter::WaitingForTarget` gains a `src_rect: cobolt_forms::model::Rect`
  field that captures the source control's `rect` at copy time
- The paste step writes `tgt.rect = src_rect` alongside the visual style properties
  and animations, so the target control becomes an exact geometric and visual copy
  of the source

#### Dead code removal — `bind_event` / `set_event_code` wiring

Removed all remnants of the old inline-editor event wiring that was superseded by
the modal `EventEditorModal` in v1.0.0:

- `pub bind_event: Option<(String, String, String)>` field removed from
  `InspectorAction` (was always `None` after the modal refactor)
- `bind_event()` and `set_event_code()` methods removed from `DesignerPanel`
- The three-line `bind_event` dispatch block removed from `DesignerPanel::handle_drag`

#### Label word wrap

Labels whose `Caption` text exceeded the control width were bleeding outside the
control border.  Two bugs were fixed:

1. **Wrong `max_width`** — `LayoutJob::wrap.max_width` was not set, so egui laid
   out the text as a single infinite line
2. **Wrong anchor for centred text** — with `halign = Align::Center`,
   `painter.galley(pos, ...)` treats `pos` as the **top-centre** anchor, not
   top-left.  `text_pos.x` was being set to `rect.min.x` (left edge), shifting
   the entire text block half a control-width to the left.  Fixed to
   `rect.center().x`.

#### IntelliSense — selection on click and Tab

Three bugs prevented selecting an autocomplete suggestion:

1. **Popup dismissal race** — `else { self.ac.visible = false; }` ran on the same
   frame the user clicked a row (the click briefly steals `TextEdit` focus, making
   `cursor_range` return `None`); the popup vanished before the click was processed.
   Fixed by removing the `else` branch entirely — the popup is now only dismissed
   by an explicit selection or Escape.

2. **Click detection on `Frame` rows** — `row_resp.response.interact(Sense::click())`
   does not detect clicks on `egui::Frame` responses because frames only sense hover.
   Fixed by replacing with `ui.interact(rect, id, Sense::click())`.

3. **Char vs byte index mismatch** — `trigger_pos` is a char index returned by
   `word_before_cursor`, but it was used directly as a byte offset in
   `String::replace_range`, causing a panic or wrong replacement on non-ASCII input.
   Fixed by converting via `tab.content.char_indices().nth(self.ac.trigger_pos)`.

#### Pointing-hand cursor on clickable elements

All interactive elements that use custom interaction (not standard egui buttons or
selectable labels) now show the `PointingHand` cursor on hover:

- **Toolbox cells** — `ui.ctx().set_cursor_icon(CursorIcon::PointingHand)` on hover
- **Canvas controls** — pointer becomes a hand when hovering any placed control
- **Properties panel event rows** — `.on_hover_cursor(CursorIcon::PointingHand)`
  on both control-event and form-event rows
- **Autocomplete popup rows** — `.on_hover_cursor(CursorIcon::PointingHand)` via
  the `click_resp` interact result

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-29

### Major — Nested-program architecture

This is the first major version bump.  The entire code generation and form storage
model has been redesigned: each event handler becomes a COBOL-85 nested
program; the `.cfrm` file is the single source of
truth; the generated `.cbl` is a build artifact the user never edits.

#### `.cfrm` file format (v1.0 — backward-compatible load)

Three new XML sections added to `.cfrm`:

- `<working-storage><![CDATA[...]]></working-storage>` — raw COBOL data declarations
  emitted verbatim into the outer program's WS; supports `GLOBAL` and `EXTERNAL`
  clauses for form-wide and cross-form data sharing
- `<form-events>` — `OnLoad` and `OnClose` lifecycle handlers stored as `<Event>`
  children with CDATA bodies
- `<deleted-controls>` — recycle bin: event code from deleted controls preserved
  here (never emitted into `.cbl`) so it can be restored later

`<Event>` elements now use start/end form with CDATA body for the user's COBOL
statements.  Old-format self-closing `<Event .../> ` tags still load correctly
(`code` will be empty).

#### Model changes (`cobolt-forms`)

- `EventBinding` gains `code: String` — raw COBOL statements for this handler
- `EventBinding::for_control(ctrl_id, event)` — auto-derives paragraph name as
  `"CTRL-ID--EVENT-NAME"` (double-hyphen separator)
- `EventBinding::has_code()`, `code_line_count()` — UI helpers
- `derive_paragraph_name(ctrl_id, event) -> String` — public utility function
- `Form` gains `user_ws_source: String`, `form_events: Vec<EventBinding>`,
  `deleted_code: Vec<DeletedControlCode>`
- `Form::new()` pre-populates `form_events` with empty `OnLoad` / `OnClose` stubs
- `Form::recycle_control(id, timestamp)` — moves event code to recycle bin before
  deleting; `restore_from_recycle(timestamp, target_id)` recovers it
- `Form::control_has_code(id)` — returns `[(event, line_count)]` for UI dialog
- `Control::ensure_event(event)` — idempotent event binding with auto-derived name
- `DeletedControlCode` struct — `control_id`, `deleted_at` (ISO timestamp), `events`

#### Properties panel (`cobolt-ide`)

- "Event Bindings" section replaced by read-only "Events" section showing `●`/`○`
  status dots and line counts per supported event; user directed to Code View to edit
- "COBOL Paragraphs" section removed from chart controls (superseded by Code View)
- `new_ev_name` / `new_ev_para` staging fields removed from `PropertiesPanel`

#### Code generation (`cobolt-codegen`) — Phase 2 complete

- `write_procedure_division()` fully rewritten to emit COBOL-85 nested-program structure
- Outer program (`COBOL-MAIN`) calls `CALL "MAIN-FORM--ON-LOAD"` / `CALL "MAIN-FORM--ON-CLOSE"` for lifecycle events; event loop dispatches to handlers via `CALL "BTN-OK--CLICK"` (not `PERFORM`)
- New `write_nested_programs()` iterates form-level events then per-control events and emits a nested program for each
- New `write_nested_program(prog_id, code, comment)` emits a self-contained `IDENTIFICATION … PROCEDURE … GOBACK. END PROGRAM name.` block; empty handlers get `CONTINUE.` with a TODO comment
- Outer program closes with `END PROGRAM <form-name>.`
- Tests updated: `generate_contains_nested_program`, `generate_contains_form_events_nested`, `generate_calls_on_load_nested`

#### Backward-compatibility removal (`cobolt-forms`)

- `Form::load_paragraph` and `Form::close_paragraph` fields removed
- `OwnedEvent::EventEmpty(String, String)` variant removed
- `load-paragraph` / `close-paragraph` attributes removed from XML save/load
- `backward_compat_empty_event_tag` test removed
- `PropertiesPanel` "On Load" / "On Close" paragraph text-edit rows removed
- `set_form_prop("LoadPara")` / `set_form_prop("ClosePara")` arms removed from designer
- Raw string delimiter in XML test changed from `r#"..."#` to `r##"..."##` (fix: `"#FFFFFF"` terminated the former prematurely)

#### IDE — Interactive event code editor (interim, Phase 5 preview)

- Events section in Properties panel replaced by a collapsible inline COBOL editor per event
- Each event row shows a `▸`/`▾` arrow, `●`/`○` code-presence dot, and line count
- Expanding a row shows the derived `PROGRAM-ID` hint and a 6-row monospace `TextEdit`
- Edits are propagated back to `EventBinding.code` via `InspectorAction::set_event_code`
- `#[derive(Default)]` added to `InspectorAction`; `set_event_code: Option<(String,String,String)>` field added

#### Toolbox icon size

- Icon buttons enlarged from 39 × 39 px to 49 × 49 px (+25 %)
- Top and left padding increased from 5 px to 10 px (+5 px each)

#### Parser — Phase 3: COBOL-85 nested program support

- `cobolt-lexer`: added `Token::End` for the bare word `"END"` (distinct from `END-IF`, `END-PERFORM`, etc.)
- `cobolt-ast/DataDecl`: added `is_global: bool` and `is_external: bool` fields
- `cobolt-ast/Program`: added `nested_programs: Vec<Program>` and `end_program_name: Option<String>` fields
- `cobolt-parser/data.rs`: `GLOBAL` and `EXTERNAL` clauses now set flags on `DataDecl` instead of being silently skipped; `Token::End` added to all stop-condition lists so data parsing halts before `END PROGRAM`
- `cobolt-parser/procedure.rs`: `Token::End` added to every stop condition in `parse_sections`, `parse_paragraphs_until_section`, `parse_paragraphs`, and the `parse_stmts` stop closures so paragraph/section collection halts before `END PROGRAM`
- `cobolt-parser/parser.rs`: `parse_program` delegates to new free function `parse_single_program`; after the `PROCEDURE DIVISION` the function loops collecting nested programs (each starting at `IDENTIFICATION`) and terminates on `END PROGRAM name.` or EOF; nested programs are stored in `Program::nested_programs`
- `cobolt-ast` tests updated with `is_global`, `is_external`, `nested_programs`, `end_program_name` fields

#### Runtime (`cobolt-runtime`) — Phase 4 complete

**`CobolEnvironment` scope management**

- `push_local_scope(items)` — inserts a nested program's own WORKING-STORAGE
  items into the shared env store and returns the list of keys that were newly
  added (items that already exist, e.g. GLOBAL names, are not overwritten)
- `pop_local_scope(keys)` — removes those keys on GOBACK, restoring the env
  to its pre-call state
- `global_items_from_data_division(data)` — collects all `is_global`-flagged
  data items from a DATA DIVISION; utility used internally by the registry builder

**`Interpreter` nested-program registry**

- New `NestedProgram` struct — holds `para_map`, `para_order`, and
  `local_items: Vec<(String, CobolValue)>` for one nested program
- New `nested_registry: HashMap<String, NestedProgram>` field on `Interpreter`
- `register_nested(prog, registry)` — free function that recursively registers a
  `Program` and all of its `nested_programs` into the registry (keyed by
  PROGRAM-ID, uppercase); called from `Interpreter::new()` at startup
- New `run_para_sequence(para_map, para_order)` method — executes a paragraph
  sequence from an explicit map (not `self.para_map`); handles GO TO within
  the nested program's own paragraph space; GOBACK propagated to caller

**`exec_call` dispatch**

- Added `_ if self.nested_registry.contains_key(&prog_name)` arm before the
  legacy flat-paragraph fallback
- On match: clones para_map + para_order + local_items out of registry (to
  avoid simultaneous mutable borrow), calls `push_local_scope`, runs
  `run_para_sequence`, calls `pop_local_scope` even on error
- GOBACK from a nested program is treated as a normal return (not an error)
- GLOBAL items from the outer program are naturally visible to nested programs
  because they live in the same `CobolEnvironment` store — no copying needed

**Tests** — `tests/test_nested_programs.rs`

- `call_nested_program_runs_and_returns` — CALL dispatches, nested program sets outer WS, returns
- `nested_local_ws_is_removed_after_goback` — local items do not persist after GOBACK
- `global_items_shared_with_nested_program` — GLOBAL WS mutations are visible in outer env
- `nested_program_internal_goto` — GO TO works within nested para_map; does not escape
- `multiple_nested_programs_dispatch_independently` — each CALL routes to the right program
- `nested_program_without_end_program_terminator` — unterminated last nested program still callable

#### IDE — modal event code editor — Phase 5 complete

The inline 6-row TextEdit in the Properties panel is replaced by a full-screen modal
editor.

- Clicking any event row (in either the control Properties or the Form Properties
  Events section) opens a centred `egui::Window` overlay
- The modal renders a read-only COBOL scaffold around two editable areas:
  - **WORKING-STORAGE SECTION** — local data items specific to this handler
    (e.g. `01 WS-MY-VAR PIC X(64) VALUE SPACES.`)
  - **PROCEDURE DIVISION body** — the user's COBOL statements
- Read-only scaffold lines are colour-coded (green for structural keywords, gray
  for division headers); editable areas use monospace 12pt with syntax hint text
- **Save** commits both `local_ws` and `code` to the model (dirty-flagged);
  **Cancel** discards changes and closes without writing
- A semi-transparent black overlay dims the canvas behind the modal
- `EventEditorModal` struct added to `designer.rs` with `ctrl_id`, `ctrl_display`,
  `event_name`, `program_id`, `ws_buf`, `proc_buf`, `orig_ws`, `orig_proc`, `saved`
- `DesignerPanel::open_event_modal(ctrl_id, event_name)` — opens the modal,
  pre-populating buffers from the model (or blank if the event has no binding yet)
- `DesignerPanel::save_event_handler(ctrl_id, event_name, ws, code)` — writes
  both buffers back into the form, for either control or form-level events
- `DesignerPanel::show_event_modal(ui)` — renders the modal; called at the end
  of `show()` so it floats above all other content

**Model** — `EventBinding` gains `local_ws: String` for per-handler WS declarations;
XML layer extended with `<LocalWS><![CDATA[...]]></LocalWS>` child element inside
`<Event>` (backward compatible: old files without `<LocalWS>` still load correctly);
codegen updated to emit `local_ws` content in the handler's WS section instead of a
placeholder comment.

**Properties panel**
- `selected_event` and `event_code_bufs` fields removed
- `InspectorAction::set_event_code` replaced by `open_event_editor: Option<(String, String)>`
  containing `(ctrl_id, event_name)`; empty `ctrl_id` = form-level event
- Form Properties section gains "⚡ Form Events" subsection with clickable `OnLoad` /
  `OnClose` rows that open the same modal

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-29

### Fix — Chart SET-TABLE generates invalid COBOL when DataSource/DataCount not set

`write_chart_stubs()` used `.map().unwrap_or_else(fallback)` to default empty
DataSource / DataCount properties, but if the property exists as an empty string
`Some("")`, `unwrap_or_else` never fires.  The result was invalid generated COBOL:

```cobol
           MOVE         TO WS-LIN-13-SELECTED-IDX        *> missing source
           CALL "COBOL-CHART-SET-TABLE" USING "LIN-13"   *> missing args
```

Fix: added `.filter(|s| !s.is_empty())` before `unwrap_or_else` so empty strings
fall through to the placeholder-name fallback (`WS-<ID>-TABLE` / `WS-<ID>-COUNT`).
Generated code now compiles cleanly even when the chart has no data binding configured.

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-29

### Fix — Runtime COBOL-* built-in calls not recognised (warn + infinite loop)

After task 64 renamed all generated identifiers from `COBOLT-*` to `COBOL-*`, the
cobolt interpreter's `match` still only recognised the old `COBOLT-WAIT-EVENT` /
`COBOLT-SET-PROPERTY` / `COBOLT-GET-PROPERTY` spellings.  Every generated form
program therefore hit `CALL to unknown program 'COBOL-WAIT-EVENT' — ignored` on
startup, and the event loop would spin forever in CLI mode.

Changes to `cobolt-runtime/src/interpreter.rs`:

- Added `"COBOL-INIT-FORM"` arm — no-op in CLI/non-GUI mode (suppress spurious warn)
- Renamed `"COBOLT-WAIT-EVENT"` → `"COBOL-WAIT-EVENT"` (old spelling kept as alias)
- **`COBOL-WAIT-EVENT` now sets `COBOL-QUIT = 1`** so the event loop exits cleanly
  in CLI mode instead of spinning until the process is killed
- Added `"COBOL-SET-PROPERTY"` / `"COBOL-GET-PROPERTY"` as primary spellings (old
  `COBOLT-*` aliases retained for backward compatibility)
- Added `"COBOL-CHART-SET-TABLE"`, `"COBOL-CHART-ADD-POINT"`, `"COBOL-CHART-CLEAR"`,
  `"COBOL-CHART-REFRESH"` stubs — log at DEBUG level in CLI mode, no warning

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-29

### New feature — Rich chart controls

Six chart control types added to the Form Designer toolbox under a new **Charts**
category.  Charts are first-class form controls that participate in the full designer
workflow: placement on the canvas, property inspection, COBOL code generation, and
XML persistence.

**Control types added**

- `BarChart` — vertical bar chart; default size 320 × 220
- `LineChart` — line/trend chart; default size 320 × 220
- `PieChart` — pie chart; default size 240 × 240
- `AreaChart` — filled area chart; default size 320 × 220
- `ScatterChart` — scatter-plot chart; default size 320 × 220
- `DonutChart` — donut / ring chart; default size 240 × 240

**Data binding**

Charts accept data via two complementary mechanisms:

1. **COBOL table binding** — pass an existing WORKING-STORAGE table and its element
   count directly:
   ```cobol
   INVOKE CHART1 SET-TABLE USING WS-SALES-TABLE WS-SALES-COUNT
   ```
2. **Point-by-point accumulation**:
   ```cobol
   INVOKE CHART1 ADD-POINT USING 'January' WS-MONTHLY-TOTAL
   INVOKE CHART1 CLEAR
   INVOKE CHART1 REFRESH
   ```

**Properties inspector** — dedicated chart section covering:

- *Visual*: Title, ShowLegend, ShowGridLines, ShowTooltips, AnimateOnLoad,
  X-axis / Y-axis labels
- *Data Binding*: DataSource, DataCount, LabelField, ValueFields, SeriesLabels
- *Type-specific*: grouped/stacked bars, smooth/stepped lines, inner-radius for
  donut, log-scale Y axis, bubble size for scatter, fill-opacity for area
- *COBOL Paragraphs*: DataChanged event paragraph stub
- *INVOKE usage hint* displayed inline

**Designer canvas** — glass-styled chart previews rendered with sample data at
design time (bars, polylines, filled polygons, scatter dots, pie/donut fan slices).

**Code generation**

- `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION` — three items per chart:
  `WS-<ID>-SELECTED-IDX` (PIC 9(4)), `-SELECTED-LBL` (PIC X(64)),
  `-SELECTED-VAL` (PIC 9(12)V99)
- `PROCEDURE DIVISION` — four stub paragraphs per chart:
  `<ID>-SET-TABLE`, `<ID>-ADD-POINT`, `<ID>-CLEAR`, `<ID>-REFRESH`

**Toolbox** — hand-drawn vector icons for all six chart types; unique ID prefixes
(`BAR`, `LIN`, `PIE`, `ARE`, `SCT`, `DNT`).

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-29

### New feature — Snap-to-grid toggle

- Added `snap_to_grid: bool` field to the `Form` model (default `true`); persisted
  as a `snap-to-grid` XML attribute in `.cfrm` files (backward-compatible: missing
  attribute defaults to `true`)
- `snap()` in the designer canvas is now dynamic — it takes `grid_px` and `enabled`
  parameters instead of using a hardcoded 4 px constant; all move/resize/place
  operations respect the per-form setting
- Added **"Snap to grid"** checkbox to the Grid section of Form Properties (sits
  directly below "Grid size"); checking/unchecking takes effect immediately for
  move, resize, and new-control placement
- Updated all `Form` struct literals in test/codegen code to include
  `snap_to_grid: true`

Versioning rules
- **PATCH** (`0.0.x`): bug fixes, polish, build corrections
- **MINOR** (`0.x.0`): new features — resets PATCH to 0
- **MAJOR** (`x.0.0`): any change to the interpreter — resets MINOR and PATCH to 0

---

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-29  *(initial tagged release)*

### Foundation (pre-tag, post-parser)

All work below was completed before the 0.0.1 tag was applied.
It is catalogued here as the baseline feature set.

---

  bring-to-front/send-to-back, delete selected; double-height toolbar
- **Z-order** — per-control z_order field; `Bring to Front` / `Send to Back`
  commands; canvas renders controls in z-order
- **Multi-select** — rubber-band selection, Shift+click toggle, group move
- **Form background** — solid fill colour (hex picker), transparency slider (0–100 %),
  background image path + stretch/tile/center/fit display modes
- **Grid density** — grid size property (8/16/32 px) on the Form, adjustable in
  Form Properties
- **Animation system** — per-control animation list; properties: name, trigger
  (`OnFormLoad`, `OnClick`, `OnHover`), easing, direction, duration, delay,
  loop count; designer-time live preview with play/stop controls;
  `AnimState` struct tracks t, playing, forward, delay_remaining
- **Preview window** — live OS window (`with_transparent(true)`) showing the form
  with liquid-glass control rendering, per-control opacity/transparency, and
  `OnFormLoad` animations auto-started on open; glass visuals applied to preview

- **Delete key guard** — Delete/Backspace only removes selected controls when no
  text-input widget has keyboard focus (`ctx.memory focused().is_none()`)
- **Target device presets** — "Target" dropdown in Form Properties with 24 device
  presets (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Android phone/tablet/watch, custom);
  selecting a preset auto-sets form width × height
- **COBOL identifier rename** — `COBOLT-*` data-division identifiers renamed to
  `COBOL-*` throughout codegen and semantic crates

*Next version: increment PATCH for fixes, MINOR for new features,
MAJOR for interpreter changes.*
